## About
The goal of this project was to create a weather application to display the current weather and 5 day forecast for a city when searched. Using a javascript function, I called the OpenWeatherApi using fetch and pulled the data from it. The data was stored in variables and then appened to the page. So when a user searches a city, the data is pulled and displayed on the page. I pulled the current weather data and the 5 day forecast. Also the suers previous searches will display underneath the search bar.
